# Notes
## Start
How shall we begin?
Is our starting point HTML5?
The unzipped HTMLZ produced by Calibre is full of calibre-styles and no specified HTML version, but it preserves media and metadata.

Perhaps we take the Pando HTML5, put it in a folder, grab the cover.jpg, /images & metadata.opf from the HTMLZ and start from there?
