# Notes
## Initial Goals
The overall goal here is to end up with examples of of "minimal viable webbooks." However, as we are starting from scratch, from different backgrounds, experiences, with different tools and processes, we need to set some initial short term goals to get the first iterations going.

* Package : A simple Directory
* Content: HTML5 files
	* Content markup is cleanly structured ( _Hx, Sections, Pararaphs, etc_ … )
	* Where necessary, Block elements are explicitly Class'ed
	* All meaningful Block elements are uniquely identified ( _Chapter heads, Sections, Paragraphs, Figures, Blockquotes_ … )
	* Optional: FrontBack Matter, Parts, Chapters are split into individual HTML5 files
	* Images/, Styles/, Fonts/ etc… follow existing models ( _EPUB_ … )
* ToC: HTML5 ( _a.k.a. "Indexes"_ )
	* Default ( _as authored_ )
	* example of Geographic ( _embedded map_ )
	* example of Timeline ( _narrative and chronological_ )
	* example of Personage ( _list, graph of relationships_ )
